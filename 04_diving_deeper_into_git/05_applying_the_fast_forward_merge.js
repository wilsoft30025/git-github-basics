/* 
    APPLYING THE FAST-FORWARD MERGE
    ----
        Let's say you have a Project which is converted into a Working Directory...

        Since it's a new project we already have the "* master branch" as the default branch. So Let me commit the changes from here and continue at my new branch.
        
        Now let's assume we create a new branch called the "feature" using the command below
            ---------------------
            git switch -c feature
            ---------------------
