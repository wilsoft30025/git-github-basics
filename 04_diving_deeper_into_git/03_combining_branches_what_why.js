/* 
    Combining Master and Feature Branches
    ---
        Master = Main project branch
            ...this is the first branch you ctreate in your project and also the braning containing your latest deployed status of your website

            so let's say you added more commits to your master branch and you later realized you need some feature that you want to work on it in a separate branch and later merge it

        Feature = Separate branch "based" on master branch

        So the idea behind the next lectures is to merge the features branch to the master branch
