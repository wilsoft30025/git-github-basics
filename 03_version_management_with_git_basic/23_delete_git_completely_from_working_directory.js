/* 
    DELETING GIT COMPLETELY FROM THE WORKING DIRECTORY
    ---
        Let's say you started a project with the "git init" and you realized that you want to completely DELETE the git from your working directory AND start again...

        In your working directory execute the following command
            -----------
            rm -rf .git
            -----------
                This will "PERMANENTLY DELETE" the ".git" folder. 
                
                After the deletion then you re-initialize your Git Again using the command below
                    --------
                    git init
                    --------
