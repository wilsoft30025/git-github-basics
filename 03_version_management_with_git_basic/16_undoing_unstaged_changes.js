/* 
    UNDOING UNSTAGED CHANGES
    ---
     Let's say our commit is successfully done. And now you apply some changes to any of your Tracked Files like what we are typing here...

     So we want to go back to the Latest Commit Status, use the ff. command
        -------------------------------------------
        git checkout 16_undoing_unstaged_changes.js
        -------------------------------------------
            since the branch we are refering to is our current branch, we use  -- or you omit it
