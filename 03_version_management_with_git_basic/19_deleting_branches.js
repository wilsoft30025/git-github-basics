    ---
        To delete a branch you need the ff command
            ---------------------------
            git branch -D second-branch
            ---------------------------
                This is for SINGLE Branch Delete

            ----------------------------------------
            git branch -D second-branch third-branch
            ----------------------------------------
                This is for MULTIPLE branch delete


                NOTE:
                    After successfully deleting, you will get a message to confirm delete success

                    In the delete branch command
                        ---
                        "d" means you can delete the branch only if it is MERGED WITH THE MASTER
                        "D" means FORCE DELETE whether merged or not
