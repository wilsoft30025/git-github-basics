/* 
    INITIALIZING THE REPOSITORY & CREATING THE FIRST COMMIT
    ---
        "git init" & "git commit"

        Let's say we have a project folder we are currently working on... these are some few git commands and theie funtions
               --------
            -> git init
               --------
                every fresh project must start with this command to intialize git so that your project folder can now turn into working directory. After executing the command you get a success message. Behind the scenes ".git" repository would be created

               ----------
            -> git status
               ----------
                this gives you information about the "working directory". This displays your current branch and all tracked and untracked files. Default you would see that No Commits yet (no snapshot)

               ---------
            -> git add .
               ---------
                for files to be tracked we use the command above to do that.
                    => Add Specific files
                            git add 07_inititialzing_the_repo.js

                    => Add All files we use (.)
