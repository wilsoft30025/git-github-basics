/* 
    BRANCHES & GIT SWITCH
    ---
        As at now all the Git commands we've learned works with all the Git Versions. Since Git has improved we see additional commands all the time...

        Some of the new commands can be used when you use Git version 2.23 and above
            ---
            git --version
            ---
                to check the current version you are using


        SWITCH BRACHES
        ---
            This allows you to "Switch" or "Create" new branches
                NOTE:
                    Switch is purposely for only branches.
