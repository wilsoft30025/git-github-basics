/*
    MERGING BRANCHES - BASICS
    ---
        As discussed earlier, touching and working on the master branch is dangerous, so it id advisable you have a branch you will work on extensively and later merge it to your master branch

        NOTE:
            Before you do the Merging, make sure you are in the Branch where additional / other branch would be added to. So here we will make sure we are in the MASTER branch

            So here we want to add our "third-branch" to the "master" so we must make sure we are currently in the "*master" before we perform the task

        To MERGE, we use the following command
            ----------------------
            git merge third-branch
            ----------------------
                So here we merged the third branch to our master branch
