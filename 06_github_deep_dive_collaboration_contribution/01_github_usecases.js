    THE 4 GITHUB USE - CASES
    ---
        Why we use GitHub? REASONS
        ---
        The reasons cab be divided in two(2) main cases
            1. SINGLE User Use Case
                ...uses GitHub for Cloud Storage
                        -> hosting of own personal project
                ...uses GitHub to present a Portfolio Page
                        -> page presenting all the core skills, projects worked on

            2. MULTIPLE Users Use Case
                ...for Collaboration 
                        (this means either you have a project and you want to add other people to collaborate with that project you on this project, or you could also be part of an organization and they have multiple projects with multiple users been part of that project)

                ...for Contributions 
                        (this means we have many open source project on GitHub for you to access it to work on it locally on your machine)

                    The difference between COLLABORATION and CONTRIBUTION is that, Collaborators are part of the actual project and Contributors are not part of the actual project BUT can contribute to open source projects if they want to
