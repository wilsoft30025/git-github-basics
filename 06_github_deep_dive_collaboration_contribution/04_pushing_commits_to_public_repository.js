/* 
    PUSHING COMMIT TO PUBLIC REPOSITORY
    ---
    Without having any GitHub account you can access a public any project repository on GitHub. By clicking on the project name and finally clicked on clone with the selected url, you can clone it to your computer

    Now let's assume we improved the code on our local machine and finally want to push it back to GitHub Account... Take Note that if you don't have any secured access to your GitHub account from your computer eg. Personal Access Token etc. there is no way you can just push your code to GitHub
