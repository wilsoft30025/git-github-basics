        To FORK a REPO
        ---
            EXAMPLE:
                With this example, let's switch form the Organization Account to the Personal Account

                Let's say we are on GitHub and see a Repo we Like
                    ...Click on the Repo
                    ...Make sure you are LOGGED In since Fork extracts into tour account
                    ...To the Top Right you will see FORK. click on it
                            ...you would be asked where you want to FORK to. Sect your Account
                            ...now the FORKING process takes a few seconds, then finally completes. This would be added to your account with the Fork Symbol attached
                    
                    ...click to open the FORKED REPO
                    ...use "git clone" to get it to your Local Machine. Let's say you updated the code on your local machine
                            -> push it to your Remote Repo i.e. my personal user account
