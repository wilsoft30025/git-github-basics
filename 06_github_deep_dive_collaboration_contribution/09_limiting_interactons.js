/* 
    LIMITING INTERACTIONS
    ---
        Restricting access to our REPO is very important. Inside our Personal User Account we have SOME OPTIONS to LIMIT so many things. Follow the steps below
            -> Go to your Profile Menu
            -> Go to settings
            -> Go to Moderation Tab
                    -------------
                    Blocked Users
                    -------------
                        -> this is used to BLOCK setting users from specific actions

                    ------------------
                    Interaction Limits
                    ------------------
                        -> We can use this to Temporarily RESTRICT which external users can interact with your repositories (comment, open issues, or create pull requests) for a configurable period of time.

                    ------------------
                    Code Review Limits
                    ------------------

                        NOTE:
                            This AFFECTS all REPOS since it was done under the MAIN SETTINGS


        HINT:
            BUT if you want to apply this limits to a specific repository, follow the steps below
                -> Go to your Repository (open a specific project)
                -> Go to Settings
                -> Scroll to the Danger Zone and Change the Visibility to Public
                -> Now go to "Moderation Options" - only shown in Public Repo
                        ...this is enabled only when your repo is "Public"
