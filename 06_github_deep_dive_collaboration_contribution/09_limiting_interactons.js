    LIMITING INTERACTIONS
    ---
        Restricting access to our REPO is very important. Inside our Personal User Account we have access to limit so many things. Follow the steps below
            -> Go to your Profile Menu
            -> Go to settings
            -> Go to Moderation Tab
                    ... Blocked Users
                            -> this is used to block setting users from specific actions

                    ... Interaction Limits
                            -> We can use this to Temporarily restrict which external users can interact with your repositories (comment, open issues, or create pull requests) for a configurable period of time.

                    ... Code Review Limits

                NOTE:
                    This affects all repositories since it was done under the main settings


        BUT if you want to apply this limits to a specific repository, follow the steps below
            -> Go to your Repository (open a specific project)
            -> Go to Settings
            -> Scroll to the Danger Zone and Change the Visibility to Public
            -> Now go to "Moderation Options"
                    ...this is enabled only when your repo is "Public"
