                                (by default you will see that you don't have any organization, so you can therefore create a new organization or you turn your current account into an organization)

                           HINT:
                                Public means "anybody" can access the repository whether LOGGED IN or NOT by using your repo url

                                Private means you are the only one who can have access to the Project
                                
                        -> You can DELETE you repository here
