    UNDERSTANDING AND ADDING A COLLABORATOR TO PRIVATE USER ACCOUNTS
    ---
        As learnt in the previous slide, we can create a personal access token ourselves and share it with the collaborator to work with on our specific project if we don't want the collaborator to access other project...

        The best option is to
            -> Login to you GitHub Account
            -> Open your specific project Repo
            -> Click on settings tab
            -> Click on Collaborators
            -> Click on Manage Access
            -> Click Add People under Manage Access
                    ...you can add people using username, full name, email of another GitHub Account
                    ...click add for invitaion to be sent
            -> Now wait for an invite approval from the invited collaborator

        NOTE:
            Now that the collaborator has access to our project, he can now create a personal access token on his own machine to be able to push the code. Follow steps to create a personal access token
                -> Go to profile menu
                -> Settings
                -> Developer Settings
                -> Personal Access Token
