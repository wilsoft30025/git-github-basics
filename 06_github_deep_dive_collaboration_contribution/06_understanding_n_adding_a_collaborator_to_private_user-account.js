/* 
    UNDERSTANDING AND ADDING A COLLABORATOR TO PRIVATE USER ACCOUNTS
    ---
        Method 1
        ---
            We can CREATE a PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN ourselves and SHARE it with the COLLABORATOR to work with on our specific project if we don't want the collaborator to access other project...

        Method 2 - BEST OPTION
        ---
            The best option is to
                -> Login to you GitHub Account
                -> Open your SPECIFIC PROJECT REPO
                -> Click on SETTINGS TAB
                -> Click on COLLABORATOR
                -> Click on "MANAGE ACCESS"
                -> Click "Add People" under "Manage Access"
                        ...you can add people using "username", "full name", "email" of another GitHub Account
                        ...click add for invitation to be sent
                -> Now wait for an invite approval from the invited collaborator

        HINT:
            Now that the COLLABORATOR has ACCESS to our project, he can now CREATE a "PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN" on his own machine to be able to push the code. 
            
            Follow steps to create a personal access token
                -> Go to "profile menu"
                -> Settings
                -> Developer Settings
                -> Personal Access Token
