        CREATING NEW ORGANIZATION REPO
        ---
            In our GitHub Organization, let's create a REPO
                i.e organization-repo-1
                        -> We leave it to "PRIVATE"
                        -> Click Create repository

        
        CREATING TEAM MEMBER'S
        ---
            -> Navigate to the Repository Created
            -> Click on Settings Tab
            -> Click on Collaborators and Team
                    ------------------
                    Private Repository
                    ------------------

                    ---------
                    Base Role
                    ---------
                        -> click on Manage
                                Base Permissions
                                    Base permissions to the organizationâ€™s repositories apply to all members and excludes outside collaborators. Since organization members can have permissions from multiple sources, members and collaborators who have been granted a higher level of access than the base permissions will retain their higher permission privileges.

                                    Meaning here we can ASSIGN Permissions for the members of the organization. Permissions like
                                        -> Read
                                                members can't push to this repo
                                        -> Write
                                        -> Admin
                    -------------
                    Direct Access
                    -------------
