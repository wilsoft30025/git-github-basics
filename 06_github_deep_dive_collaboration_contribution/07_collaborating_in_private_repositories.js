/* 
    COLLABORATING IN PRIVATE REPOSITORIES
    ---
        In the previous lecture, we used "PUBLIC" Repo, so what changes if we turned it to "PRIVATE"

        When the REPO is turned to "PRIVATE", the added collaborator can still push code to the repo and it will work very fine... The collaborator has the same right in the PRIVETE and PUBLIC repository
