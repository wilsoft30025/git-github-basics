/* 
    GITHUB SECURITY & ACCESS
    ---
        When you want to PUSH, we at least need a PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN. Let's say we have the following

            --------------
            Local Git User
            --------------
                
                ------------------------
                -> Personal Access Token
                ------------------------
                   (This gives us access to the GitHub account via Git). 
                   
                   NOTE: 
                        If a wrong person gets access to your token then he automatically gets access to your GitHub account

                        This is your KEY to GitHub via Git

                        This is for when you want to contribute to your own project

                   NOTE: 
                        Things become more complicated when you have Multiple people want to contribute to your project

                        Now let's differentiate
                            ---------------------
                            Personal user account
                            ---------------------
                                -> Owner Access
                                -> Collaborator Access
                                        (eg. a collaborator cloned our project, worked on it and wants to push it back to GitHub)

                            --------------------
                            Part of organization
                            --------------------

            --------------
            GitHub Account
            --------------
