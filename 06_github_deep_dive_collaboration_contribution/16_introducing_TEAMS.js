    INTRODUCING TEAMS
    --- 
        Here we will EXPLORE what TEAM means. Team seams to be awesome because they allow "Seamless communication".
            -> Flexible repository access
                    ... You can add repositories to your teams with more flexible levels of access (Admin, Write, Read).
            
            -> Request to join teams
                    ... Members can quickly request to join any team. An owner or team maintainer can approve the request.

            -> Team mentions
                    ... Use team @mentions (ex. @github/design for the entire team) in any comment, issue, or pull request.

                            ---------------
                            -> Repositories
                            ---------------
                                    ...this is where to ADD all the REPOS (i.e more than one) for your TEAM. You can assign a specific repo in your project to the team here. We don't create new BUT we assign
                                    ...after adding the REPO, you can EDIT the permission level. This can be done for individual repo(...Read, Write)
                                        HINT:
                                            This is what we couldn't achieve with previous "COLLABORATORS" or "MEMBERS"
