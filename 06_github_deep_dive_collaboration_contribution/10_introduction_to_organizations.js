    GITHUB SECURITY & ACCESS
    ---
        When you want to PUSH, we at least need a personal access token. Let's say we have the following

            --------------
            Local Git User
            --------------
                
                ------------------------
                -> Personal Access Token
                ------------------------
                   (This gives us access to GitHub account via Git). Take note that if a wrong person gets access to your token then he automatically gets access to your GitHub account

                   This is your KEY to GitHub via Git

                   Take note that this is for when you want to contribute to your own project

                   NOTE: 
                        Things become more complicated when you Multiple people want to contribute to your project

                                -> Collaborator Access
