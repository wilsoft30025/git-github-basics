/* 
    PUSHING A SECOND COMMIT
    ---
        Here we assume the first commit was successfully pushed. To push the second commit, we assume we updated our local repository

        After that
            ...we add to STAGING AREA
            ...add COMMIT
            ...then use the ff command to push again
                    -----------------------
                    git push -u origin main
                    -----------------------
                        This will PUSH successfully. Now you can confirm by going to GitHub and refreshing the page.
