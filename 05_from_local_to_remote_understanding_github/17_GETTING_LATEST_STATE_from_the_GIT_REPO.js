/* 
    GETTING LATEST STATE FROM THE GIT REPO
    ---
        Let's say you have your project on GitHub and your local copy intact... Assuming you updated something directly from GITHUB. Then you later updated something on your local copy as well... If you try to push your code on GitHub, you have as ERROR message that you don't have the latest information...

        So now you will use the command
            --------------------
            git pull origin main
            --------------------
                This PULLS the STATE information from GitHub. It will give you information about the "new update". Because you has a BRAND NEW COMMIT on the Remote Repo
