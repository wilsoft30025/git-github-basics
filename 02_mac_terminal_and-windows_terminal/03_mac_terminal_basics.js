        -> ROOT Directory 
                ...this is where we have SYSTEM relevant data like" Application", "Library", System etc.

        -> USERS Directory
                ...this is where we have USER relevant data like "wilfredafagbegee" etc 
                        i.e the users you have on your machine.

                ...selecting a USER in the Users Directory takes you to the Home Directory


    Anytime you open a new Terminal it takes you to Starting Directory 
        i.e "Home Directory". Below are some of the commands we use in the terminal

        -> pwd (print working directory)
                ...this prints the current directory we are currently at.
                        -----
                        /Users/wilfredafagbegee
                        -----

        -> ls (list items)
                ...this lists all the items we have in our current folder in our current directory

        -> ~
                ... this indicates that we are currently in the Home Directory
               
        -> cd (change directory)
                ... cd displays the current directory
                ... cd.. means Go Up one Hierarchy Level
                ... use cd ~ to navigate to the "Home" Directory anywhere you are
                ... use cd /Users to navigate to the "Users" Directory anywhere you are
                ... use cd / to navigate to the "Root" Directory anywhere you are


        -> clear
                ...this clears the current screen without loosing your previous commands
