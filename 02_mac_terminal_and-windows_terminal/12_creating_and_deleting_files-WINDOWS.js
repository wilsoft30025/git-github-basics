    CREATING FOLDERS
    ---
        To CREATE a folder we use the command "mkdir"
            meaning "make directory i.e create folder"
                ----------
                mkdir Test
                ----------
                    Folder called Test is created


    CREATING FILES
    ---
        To create a SINGLE file we use the command "echo"
                ------------------------------
                echo i am a text file test.txt
                ------------------------------
                    -> echo 
                    -> the content of the file
                    -> filename and file type

                    Now to see what is inside of the file then you use the command
                        -------------
                        type test.txt
                        -------------

    
    DELETING FILES
    ---
        To delete a file we use the command "del"
            ------------
            del test.txt
            ------------
                This command deletes the file PERMANENTLY without a PROMPT. Make sure you decide well before using the command because you cannot find it in the Recycling Bin / Trash
